## The code base was inherited from https://github.com/luost26/score-denoise, the scripts where changes were made have been included (finetune.py, test.py)

## The script display.py can be imported to convert pointclouds from xyz format to png images.

## swap_clean_point.py generates our intermediate iterate.

## The dataset used for testing was PUNet with 50000 points and 1% noise.

## Inside the Results_for_Intermediate_Layer_Dtby2 and Results_for_Usual_Layer_Dt folder, you will find logs file which contains the specifications of parameters for the run.

## Inside the pcl folder, you can find the denoised point clouds.
